# Covid-19-Tracker-Website-HTML-CSS-JavaScript

This project was a huge learning curve for me as this was the first time I used HTML, CSS or JavaScript in a project. 


The simple web-app tracks covid cases in India. You can see each states details by searching a state name or by tapping your state in the map or by looking at the table.

[The api used for the data](api.covid19india.org/data.json)

I also used Mapbox to integrate the map.
